# TYPO3 Step-By-Step Guide Template

*This template includes writing instructions {in curly brackets} and boilerplate text that you can customize with your own text. The [step-by-step Contributor Guide](../20ContributorGuide/Index.md) explains each section in detail, and includes example text for each section. Search the [Guide Registry](../../80GuidesRegistry/Index.md) before you start - your guide might already exist!*

{The template includes an HTML comment with different tags for categorization (look in the source code). Include the ones you think fits and feel free to add new ones. A tag like #TYPO3v13 indicates that the step-by-step guide has been tested in TYPO3 v13. To credit yourself as author, use "@" followed by your my.typo3.org username (e.g. "@username").}
