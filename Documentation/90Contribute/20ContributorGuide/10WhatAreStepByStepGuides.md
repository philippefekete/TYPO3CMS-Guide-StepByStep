# What are step-by-step guides?

TYPO3 step-by-step guides are hands-on tutorials designed to help newcomers **accomplish one practical task**.

Inspired by the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/map/#expectations-and-guidance), which emphasizes distinct content types in technical documentation, step-by-step guides map to the *tutorials* category.

TYPO3 step-by-step guides follow a few key principles:

* **Hands-on learning**: The fastest way to learn is by doing.
* **One clear path**: No branches — just one method that works, from start to finish.
* **Minimal explanation**: Explain only what’s necessary to keep someone moving. Link out for deeper context.
* **A successful finish**: Every step produces visible progress, and the outcome is reliable and repeatable.
* **Aligned with TYPO3’s official documentation**: Linking out to deeper material as needed.
* Takes **less than 30 minutes** to complete

> [!TIP]
> A good step-by-step guide follows the [single-responsibility principle (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle): **it should do one thing, and do it well.** > Every step contributes directly to a single learning objective, and nothing more.
>
> If you find yourself adding “If…” or “Alternatively…”, your guide may violate the single-responsibility principle.

## What are they not?

Step-by-step guides aren’t examples. Examples are usually found in the documentation, and help to illustrate concepts — they are meant to be studied and understood. Step-by-step guides, in contrast, take the reader through a path of sequential steps, and are designed to be actively followed to learn a new concept.

## Modular by design

Step-by-step guides are modular. Each guide is an atomic unit of action — small, focused, and self-contained, with one learning objective and one clear outcome. Guides can be combined to form larger tutorials or workshops, or used independently for self-led learning.

| **Information oriented** Supports exploration and problem-solving for people seeking answers or understanding. | **Learning oriented** Helps people learn through hands-on experience.                                                |
| **Comprehensive** Presents various approaches, configurations, and possibilities. Also covers edge cases.      | **Single clear path** Follows a carefully managed path from start to finish with guaranteed success.                 |
| **Blends doing and explaining** Combines how-to instructions, explanations, and reference information.         | **Focused on doing** Prioritizes action with minimal explanation. Links out to deeper material in the documentation. |
